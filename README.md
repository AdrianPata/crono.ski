#CRONO.SKI

**CRONO.SKI** is an electronic timing system for skiers which can be used by other athletes as well. It's main purpose is to assist the training.

##Basic idea

The trainer will set up a [**track**][1] for the athletes to go through it as fast as they can, multiple times. All the results are stored for further investigation and are relevant for the training process.

The system will provide the capability to identify the athletes, mark the beginning and the end of the track and measure the time it took for the athlete to go between the two.


##Components
- [**CronoStart**](CronoStart/) is a mobile electronic device which is able to identify the athlete, measure the time and send the results to a centralized database.
- **CronoHub**
- **CronoWeb**
